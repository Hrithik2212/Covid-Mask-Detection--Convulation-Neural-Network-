# Covid-Mask-Detection-AI

In this project I have created an Convulation Neural Netwoork from scratch to detect wether a person is wearing a mask or not.
The Deep Learning Model has achieved a 97.1 percent accuracy 
the code for the Machine Learning Model is in the train_model.ipynb file 
We havent presented the machine Leaerning model in this file , So in order to get the model runn all the cells in train_model.ipynb file along with 
mentioning the paths correctly according to your pc evironment 
In order to work several packages are meant to be installed 
->tensorflow 
->keras
->numpy
->opencv 

The Deep Learing model is then implemented in the
